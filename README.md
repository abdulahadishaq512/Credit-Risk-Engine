# Credit-Risk-Engine
A machine learning pipeline for credit risk assessment that utilizes SQL for data management, Random Forest for default prediction, and a Streamlit-based web interface for real-time risk evaluation.
Features

• SQL Integration: 
Normalized data management using sqlite3.

• Feature Engineering: 
Created custom domain-specific metrics like Loan_to_Income_Ratio to improve model predictive power.

• Predictive Modeling: 
Utilized RandomForestClassifier to identify high-risk loan profiles.

• Interactive Dashboard: 
Deployed a web-based interface using streamlit for live risk inference.

Tech Stack
• Language: Python 3.12

• Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, streamlit, joblib

• Data Management: sqlite3, Kaggle API

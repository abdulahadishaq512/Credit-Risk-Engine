# Bank Loan Risk Engine

A machine learning pipeline for credit risk assessment that predicts loan default probability using SQL data management, Random Forest classification, and a real-time Streamlit web interface.
 **[Live Demo](https://bank-loan-risk-engine.streamlit.app/)** |  **[GitHub](https://github.com/abdulahadishaq512/Bank-Loan-Risk-Engine)**

## Features

SQL Integration, Normalized data management using SQLite with multi-table joins
Feature Engineering, Custom domain-specific metric Loan_to_Income_Ratio to improve predictive power
Predictive Modeling, Random Forest classifier achieving ~85% accuracy on held-out test data
Interactive Dashboard, Real-time risk inference via a deployed Streamlit web app

## How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository:
bashgit clone https://github.com/abdulahadishaq512/Bank-Loan-Risk-Engine.git
cd Bank-Loan-Risk-Engine
2. Install dependencies:
bashpip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the application:
bashstreamlit run app.py

## How It Works

Data Ingestion, Dataset downloaded via Kaggle API and stored in a normalized SQLite database across 3 tables (Users, Financials, Loan_Status)
Feature Engineering, SQL JOIN query extracts relevant features; Loan_to_Income_Ratio computed as a custom risk metric
Model Training, Random Forest trained on encoded features with 80/20 train-test split
Deployment, Model serialized with joblib and served via Streamlit Cloud
